# HR_Analytics Project

In this data analyst project, we analyzed HR data provided by a company in Excel. Our goal was to gain insights into the percentage of employees taking sick leaves and to identify trends in employees working from home.

To achieve this, we used Power Query to transform the data and make it suitable for analysis. We cleaned the data, removed any duplicates if existed or errors, and created relationships between different data tables.

Once the data was prepared, we visualized the insights using Power BI. We created various charts and graphs to display the data and highlighted key trends, such as the percentage of employees taking sick leave with respect to months or the number of employees working from home by month.

Our analysis provided valuable insights for the company's HR department, allowing them to identify areas where they could increase productivity.
